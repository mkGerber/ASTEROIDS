ASTEROIDS game

This was a project for my college Computer Science class where we are learning java currently. The game was a recreation of the retro game called asteroids.
It is where you are playing as a ship and you have to move around to shoot and destroy enemy asteroids and saucers. The game that I created is fully functional. 
The goal of the game is to rack up as many points as possible from destroying enemies. Although, you only have 3 lives which can be taken away when you
run into an enemy.
